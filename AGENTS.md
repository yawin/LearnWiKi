# Project: LearnWiki

## Permissions

- You may run any shell commands needed for development (npm, cargo, npx, etc.)
- You may read, write, and edit any files in this project
- You may run `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `cargo build`, `cargo check`, `cargo tauri dev` and similar development commands freely
- You may install npm packages and cargo crates as needed
- You may run tests freely
- You may create, delete, and modify files within this project directory

## Decision Protocol

- For routine development tasks (coding, debugging, refactoring, testing): proceed autonomously, no need to ask
- For important project direction decisions (architecture changes, new major dependencies, data model redesign, feature scope changes): ask the user first, present 2-3 options with a recommended choice clearly marked
- If the user does not respond within 3 minutes: proceed with the recommended option and note what was chosen
- The user is a beginner — always explain decisions in plain Chinese, avoid jargon

## GitHub

- Repository: https://github.com/kdsz001/LearnWiki
- When user says "存一下" or "保存进度": commit + push to GitHub
- Write clear commit messages in conventional format (feat/fix/refactor)

## Release workflow

User is non-technical and doesn't maintain the `release-notes/` folder
or run any release commands manually. When user says "发版", "发 release",
"打 tag", "发个新版本", or similar, Codex owns the full release flow.
**Read `release-notes/README.md` first** — it has the step-by-step
checklist (pick version number, summarize commits into user-facing
bullets, create `release-notes/vX.Y.Z.md` from TEMPLATE.md, bump the
three version files, run `cargo check` to sync Cargo.lock, commit, tag,
push, push tag). After pushing the tag, report back with the Actions
URL so the user can watch the DMG build.

The key rule: never paste raw commit messages into release notes.
Rewrite everything into short user-facing sentences like "优化了 X" or
"修复了 X", no technical details.

## Design System
Always read DESIGN.md before making any visual or UI decisions.
All font choices, colors, spacing, and aesthetic direction are defined there.
Do not deviate without explicit user approval.
In QA mode, flag any code that doesn't match DESIGN.md.

## Skill routing

When the user's request matches an available skill, ALWAYS invoke it using the Skill
tool as your FIRST action. Do NOT answer directly, do NOT use other tools first.
The skill has specialized workflows that produce better results than ad-hoc answers.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas, "is this worth building", brainstorming → invoke office-hours
- Bugs, errors, "why is this broken", 500 errors → invoke investigate
- Ship, deploy, push, create PR → invoke ship
- QA, test the site, find bugs → invoke qa
- Code review, check my diff → invoke review
- Update docs after shipping → invoke document-release
- Weekly retro → invoke retro
- Design system, brand → invoke design-consultation
- Visual audit, design polish → invoke design-review
- Architecture review → invoke plan-eng-review
